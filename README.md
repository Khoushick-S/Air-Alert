## Short Description

### What's the problem?

Air pollution is obviously the major cause of global warming which has led to climate change. Though there are many causes of air pollution, vehicular pollution and industrial pollution have been greatly contributing to it.

### The Idea

People can keep track of air quality in and around their area. They get personalised suggestions to control the traffic based on different range of alerts. Traffic congestion is reduced and air pollution is controlled by a great percentage leading to the reduction of global warming.

### How can Technology Help?

Get updates about air pollution in your city.

AirAlert provides hourly updates about air pollution in key cities in India. AirAlert allows you to track air pollution in your city and take informed actions to avoid airborne pollution that may impact your quality of life or cause severe adverse health effects. Designed for intuitive use, AirAlert rates urban air quality in accordance to the Air Quality Index.

## Demo Video

A brilliant solution to monitor and analyse the percentage of gases in the atmosphere by collecting unlimited data and precise decision making.

1. The user enters the app by signing in.
2. The user's location is detected and the air quality around that place is displayed.
3. Based on the level of pollution, different alert signals are given.
4. User is asked about the purpose of travel and suggested the best option to reduce pollution.

## Long Description

### Problem

Air pollution is obviously the major cause of global warming which has led to climate change. Though there are many causes of air pollution, vehicular pollution and industrial pollution have been greatly contributing to it.

### Our Solution

**★ The Clear Cause**

The major cause of vehicular pollution is traffic congestion. In most urban cities, the number of motor vehicles is high and as such, there is a congestion of traffic. When these many vehicles congest in a singular area, the emissions per kilometre go up, contributing to vehicular pollution. The carbon dioxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which include halocarbons, hydrocarbons and oxygenates, are observed to be 250% more in urban and congested areas than areas with moving traffic, and result in the formation of secondary pollutants. Most city governments can take action to lower vehicular pollution, seeing that more emissions are produced by vehicles in urban areas because of high population of vehicles at use.

**★ Distinctive Prevention**

The pollution control board of the government can regularly keep track of the air quality by fixing pollution measuring devices at the pollution hotspots like main roads and signals in metro cities and industrial areas. These devices would measure the levels of green house gases and humidity around a particular radius of area. Our application, Air-Alert would be connected to these sensors, so that the quality of air is updated on the app every hour. This app can show the level of pollution wherever the sensors are fixed. Four ranges of indications would be shown where, the green signal means good air quality, the yellow signal means average quality of air, the orange signal means bad quality of air and the red signal means the worst air quality. Based on this, the app would strictly recommend the people to use public transportation or bicycle or even not to use vehicles until the green signal is shown. Air-Alert would notify about the traffic level that has to maintained in order to keep the air quality good. Traffic police could take actions if excessive unwanted vehicles are found to be roaming. By this traffic congestion could be controlled every hour. Eventually vehicular pollution can be kept in control.

**★ Limited Pollution**

Pollution caused by industries can also be reduced by keenly monitoring the toxic emissions from the factories every day. Devices measuring the amount of greenhouse gases emitted from the factories would be connected to our app. These data could ensure that the factories do not exceed the limits fixed by the government. By this, the industrial pollution can also be maintained at low levels.

**★ Cooler and Cleaner World!**

This solution would make a big difference in the air quality. Every day’s air quality can be controlled and maintained at good levels. Eventually this would reduce the increasing temperature and keep our place much cooler and cleaner than ever before. When this trend is practiced in many cities and industries, it would lead to reduced global warming and less consequences.

## Solution Roadmap

The roadmap to our project is presented below.
